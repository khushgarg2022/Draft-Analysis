# Fantasy Draft-Analysis

# Project Description

- Extracted performance statistics of around 10,000 National Hockey League(NHL) players across all seasons from 2011-2020 using web scraping and stored in a local database.

- Utilized recurrent neural networks to predict the player's performance for any given season until 2024 using their historical data

- Assessed the impact of an individualâ€™s performance on the overall performance of the team, based on estimations conducted through simulations in R and derived a data-driven rating that allowed for comparisons between a specific player and the next best player and the average player in the same position and all other positions.

- Designed an algorithm by training neural networks on the simulated data to implement it for draft analysis.

- Generated a grade for each user that reflected the performance of his team up to any arbitrary point during the NHL Season and highlighted which player picks ended up being poor, good, or neutral in comparison to the next player chosen for the same position in the subsequent rounds of a snake-order draft.

- Designed a dynamic website that allowed users to view predicted statistics and projected rankings of the players across all positions for any given NHL season and draft their own fantasy team and compete against each other.
